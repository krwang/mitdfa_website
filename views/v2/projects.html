                        <p>Every four seconds, a child is treated for an injury in an emergency department. To begin treating injuries, doctors and nurses use pain assessment tools to determine the location and intensity of the patient's pain. Current pain assessment tools (1) don't capture multiple pain dimensions at once and (2) only measure pain at a single point in time. <br><br><b>This is where the Boo Boo Buddy can help.</b><br><br>
                         Designed with children in mind, the Boo Boo Buddy is a <span class='bold'><i>dry erasable stuffed animal</i></span> that allows children to (1) mark where it hurts (2) add stickers to show how much it hurts (3) update their boo-boos over time to track recovery progress. Using an accompanying <span class='bold'><i>smartphone app</i></span>, the Boo-Boo Buddy will allow doctors and nurses to track changes in a patient's pain level over time and gain insight into treatment effectiveness.

                    <h2>Our Process</h2>
                    <div class="slide summary">
                        <p>1)<b> Identify a Target Population</b>: We targeted the homeless populations of Boston and Cambridge. We realized that people experiencing homelessness have a rather unique set of needs, and the <span class='bold'>resources currently available to them aren't enough to meet those needs.</span></p>

                        <p>2) <b> Scope Out the Problems</b>: Our first step was to learn about the issues faced by people experiencing homelessness. Through our conversations with homeless men and women, and staff at homeless shelters, we identified four issues:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Theft</li>
                            <li>Medication Adherence</li>
                            <li>Shelter and Warmth</li>
                            <li>Resource Allocation</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>3) <b>Ideate Ideate Ideate!</b>: We came up with three potential solutions to the problems we identified:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><i>The Invest</i>, to address theft and medication adherence. The Invest is a lightweight vest that can be worn beneath other clothing to provide safe, simple storage of valuables and medications.</li>
                            <li><i>The Elemental</i>, to address lack of shelter and warmth. The Elemental is a lightweight backpack, which expands into a shelter at night to provide warmth and protection from the elements.</li>
                            <li><i>The Allocator</i>, to address resource allocation. The Allocator is an app to help organizations allocate resources more effectively to the homeless population they serve.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>4) <b>Create a Solution</b>: We decided to develop <i>the Allocator </i>because by helping shelters efficiently distribute resources, it could have a big impact on how many people are connected with the help they need.</p>
                            
                        <p>There are two main features we have in mind. The first involves street teams <span class='bold'>recording the number of people they see and the resources</span> (food, hats, blankets, etc.) they hand out at certain points on their route. They can enter this information by tapping a location on a map and typing the information into a pop-up box. The information is compiled and then presented so that organizations can see trends, such as the most popular locations and resources at a certain time of year or the most needed resources for a specific location. This will allow organizations to effectively plan for their trips and can ease the transition for new members of a street team.</p>

                        <p>The other feature is a <span class='bold'>directory</span>, which keeps track of <span class='bold'>events </span>happening at local shelters, the <span class='bold'>number of beds </span>available at various shelters, and the location of resources such as health clinics and food pantries. We hope that if we gather data from enough organizations, this would provide a centralized source where homeless people could find programs that meet their needs.

                        <p>Hunger is not a third-world problem. It is all around us, invisible and sinuous in the people it touches and and the ways it affects them. The hunger within the Greater Boston community manifests itself largely in households reducing their food intake and reducing the quality and variety of their diet due to competing basic needs. For example, <b>over half of the hungry interviewed by the Greater Boston food had to choose between food and utilities (such as heat and electricity), rent and mortgage payments, and medical care</b>. These choices are unacceptable, because food security should be a basic right. In particular, we are trying to help working families who do not receive enough government assistance to support their households and who cannot take advantage of local food pantries who have limited hours of operations. We are working to <b><span class='bold'>increase the accessibility and the availability of food to these families</span></b> in partnership with already established food pantries and community centers.</p>

                        <p>Teachers spend hours every day designing worksheets that cover the same concepts that are taught all around the world. While the content has been taught many times before, teachers often create their worksheets from scratch because its hard to find material that matches their teaching style. Our team is creating an online platform that allows teachers to drag and drop questions from a bank of crowdsourced problems to <i>easily</i> customize the perfect worksheet that fits their teaching style and their classroom. Additionally, the platform can recommend questions based on the types of problems they have used for previous worksheets. This can save hours of time every day, allowing teachers to focus on students who need the most help or take some time to relax before after a busy day at school.</p>
