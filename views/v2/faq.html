                <h1>What does Design for America do?</h1>
                <p>MIT Design for America is dedicated to design for social impact. We run project teams, hackshops and design challenges.</p>
                <p>Project teams work on designing a year-long solution to problems in our local community such as homelessness and community hunger. See some of our past and current projects on our project page!</p>
                <p>Hackshops are monthly workshops open to all of campus that teach new skills such as Arduino and graphic design in the context of human-centered design. Check out past and upcoming hackshops here.</p>
                <p>Design challenges are open to all of campus and encourage students to design a solution to a pressing problem in the world. We&#39;re always planning great challenges like hacking wearables for social good and we&#39;d love for you to join us. Check out what challenges are coming up here!</p>

                <h1>Why should I join DFA?</h1>
                <p>More than ever, strong science and engineering foundations are not enough. The key to creating awesome innovations is to consider your user, and we&#39;re here to teach you exactly how to do that. You will also get the real world experience of carrying out a project from ideation to creation and designing a solution that could make a huge impact on the world. DFA is also the largest group of impact-driven students at MIT and we would love for you to join our community!</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h1>I don&#39;t have experience, can I still join DFA?</h1>
                <p>Of course! We&#39;re all about teaching you new skills and expanding your capabilities; all we ask is for you to bring your ideas and eagerness to learn. From internal lesson sessions exclusively for project teams to on-the-job experiences, you will have plenty of opportunities to learn exactly what you&#39;re interested in.</p>
